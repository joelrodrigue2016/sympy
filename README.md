## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SymPy



SymPy is an open-source Python library for symbolic computation. It provides computer algebra capabilities either as a standalone application, as a library to other applications, or live on the web as SymPy Live or SymPy Gamma.
The SymPy library is split into a core with many optional modules.
